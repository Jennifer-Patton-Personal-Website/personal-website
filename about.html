    <h2>Getting to know me...</h2>
    <p>My work background is very unqiue.  I started working as a children's entertain when I was 14 years old for my mother's company.  I learned at a young age how to manage 50+crowd, and learn how to think fast on my feet and time magement.  When I graduated from the University of South Carolina, I started working as a Applied Behavioral Analysist (ABA) therapist.  Working with a team to help an individual that is dianosis with Autism to learn new skills in order to improve their quailty of life.  Working in a team, I had to learn how to communicate struggles, growth, and track data in order to see if a program is working or do we need to adjust. Working with computres and graphing data points, reminded me how much I love computres and set me on a new path of learning how to code. </p>
