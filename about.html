<div class="hobby">
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>Whether it is reading a supernatural thriller, fantasty, or historical fiction.  You find me reading in my comfy bed or outside at the park.  Favorite series that I am reading right now is The Dreseden Files by Jim Butcher.</p>
 <hr>
    <h3>Table Top Role Playing Games</h3>
    <p>Meeting with my friends on a specific day we create characters in an open interactive, responsive world facilitated by a game master.  We participate in a fun structured cooperative activity with predictable rules and an unpredictable outcomes. Table Top RPG is a great way to learn how to be flexible and problem solve.</p>

    <h3>Arts and Craft </h3>
    <p>Making unquie dice boxes for my friends.  Creating and painting a theme box to look like either a create from Dungeons and Dragons or pretty objects they would see in that world.</p>
