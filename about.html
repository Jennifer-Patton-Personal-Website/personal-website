    <h2>Getting to know me...</h2>
    <p>My name is Jennifer Patton.  I am 36 years old and married to a wonderful man of 8 years, but who have known since Middle School.  I have an interesting work background.  I started working for my mother's company as a children enterainer (doing magic,balloon twisting, and face painting).  This experience taught me how time management, think fast on my feet, and manage huge crowds.  From there I develop a love of psychology and for the last 10 years I been working as a Applied Behavioral Analysist Therapist. This taught me how to work as a team.  It also taught me how to analyize progress and communicate this progress.</p>
